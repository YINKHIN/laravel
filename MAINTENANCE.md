# System Maintenance Guide

## Overview
This document describes the maintenance features implemented in the Inventory Management System to ensure optimal performance, reliability, and data safety.

## Automated Database Backups

### Features
- Daily automated database backups
- Compression support to save disk space
- Automatic cleanup of old backups (keeps last 5 by default)
- Configurable backup destination and retention

### Commands
```bash
# Create a backup
php artisan db:backup

# Create a compressed backup
php artisan db:backup --compress

# Create a backup with custom retention
php artisan db:backup --keep-last=10

# Create a backup to a specific destination
php artisan db:backup --destination=/path/to/backups
```

### Scheduled Backups
Backups are automatically scheduled to run daily at 2:00 AM via the task scheduler.

## System Monitoring

### Features
- Database health checks
- System resource monitoring
- Application performance metrics
- Scheduled task verification
- Logging and alerting capabilities

### Commands
```bash
# Run system monitoring
php artisan system:monitor

# Log results to file
php artisan system:monitor --log

# Send alerts for issues
php artisan system:monitor --alert

# Set custom performance threshold
php artisan system:monitor --threshold=100
```

### API Endpoints
The system provides RESTful API endpoints for health checks:

```
GET /api/system/health    # System health status
GET /api/system/metrics   # Detailed system metrics
```

### Scheduled Monitoring
System monitoring runs hourly to track performance and detect issues early.

## Log Management

### Features
- Automatic cleanup of old log files
- Configurable retention period
- Disk space optimization

### Commands
```bash
# Clean logs older than 30 days
php artisan logs:clean

# Clean logs with custom retention
php artisan logs:clean --days=7

# Force deletion without confirmation
php artisan logs:clean --force
```

### Scheduled Cleanup
Log cleanup runs weekly to maintain optimal disk space usage.

## Performance Optimization

### Database Indexes
The system uses optimized database indexes for common queries:
- Primary keys on all tables
- Indexes on frequently queried columns
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity

### Caching
- Application-level caching for frequently accessed data
- Cache expiration policies to ensure data freshness
- Cache warming for improved response times

### Resource Management
- Memory usage monitoring
- Connection pooling for database queries
- Efficient query optimization

## Error Reporting

### Logging
- Comprehensive error logging to files
- Structured log format for easy parsing
- Log rotation to prevent disk space issues
- Error context and stack traces

### Monitoring
- Real-time error detection
- Performance degradation alerts
- System health status reporting

## Update Management

### Database Migrations
- Version-controlled database schema changes
- Automated migration execution
- Rollback capabilities for failed updates

### Application Updates
- Semantic versioning for releases
- Backward compatibility maintenance
- Update documentation and release notes

## Best Practices

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
1. **Daily**: Database backups, system monitoring
2. **Weekly**: Log cleanup, performance review
3. **Monthly**: Security audit, capacity planning

### Performance Monitoring
- Monitor database response times
- Track system resource usage
- Review application logs for errors
- Analyze user experience metrics

### Security Considerations
- Secure backup storage
- Access control for maintenance commands
- Regular security updates
- Data encryption for sensitive information

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Slow Database Queries**: Check slow query log, optimize indexes
2. **High Memory Usage**: Review application code, implement caching
3. **Disk Space Issues**: Run log cleanup, check backup retention
4. **Connection Errors**: Verify database configuration, check connection limits

### Diagnostic Commands
```bash
# Check system health
php artisan system:monitor --log

# Verify database connection
php artisan db:backup --database=test

# Review recent logs
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
```

## Scheduled Tasks

All maintenance tasks are configured in `app/Console/Kernel.php`:

- Daily reports: 1:00 AM
- Database backups: 2:00 AM
- System monitoring: Hourly
- Log cleanup: Weekly

To run the scheduler, add this cron entry:
```bash
* * * * * cd /path/to/project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```
